# MATRICES

Write Out a Tiny Example:
Use a 2x2 or 3x3 matrix and label the indices for each element.

List Original and Target Indices:
For each element, write its original (i, j) and where it should go in the new matrix.

Look for a Numeric Pattern:
Compare the original and new indices.

Is one index reversed?
Are they swapped?
Is there a subtraction from size - 1?
Test Your Formula:
Plug in values for i and j to see if your formula matches the pattern you wrote out.

Generalize:
Once you see the pattern, write it as a formula for all elements.

# NON MATRIX PROBLEMS

For non-matrix problems, you can use a similar, systematic approach to avoid relying on visualization:

Work With Examples:
Write out a small input and the expected output. List the steps you’d take to get from input to output.

Track Data With Variables:
Focus on how data changes step by step. Use variables and write down their values at each step.

Identify Patterns or Rules:
Ask: What operation or rule connects the input to the output? Is it addition, sorting, counting, etc.?

Generalize With Formulas or Algorithms:
Once you see a pattern, express it as a formula or a set of steps (algorithm), not as a picture.

Write Pseudocode:
Before coding, write the logic in plain language or pseudocode. This helps you focus on the process, not the visuals.

Test With Edge Cases:
Try your logic on unusual or minimal cases to see if your rules hold.

If you practice breaking problems into steps and focusing on the data and rules, you’ll build the habit of thinking algorithmically instead of visually. Want to try this approach on a sample non-matrix problem together?
