# General Coding Asessment Training

## each problem will be done according to the following:

### 1. Declaring The Input & Output 
- decare the input and output of the program and what it represents

### 2. Understanding the State 
- the state of the problem is the minimum set of variables needed to take a snapshot of the systems
- ASK "if I paused the program, what numbers would I need to write down"

### 3. Understanding the Transition
- what are the if/else situations that will cause our state variables to change later
- ASK "What specific events forces me to change my numbers"
- ASK "What specific events forces me to update my data structure"

### 4. Looking At The Constraints

**BRUTE FORCE, BACKTRACKING, RECURSION**
- if n <= 12: complexity can be O(n!)
- if n <= 25: complexity can be O(2n)

**GREEDY, TWO POINTER, HEAP, DP, SLIDING WINDOW**
- if n <= 100: complexity can be O(n^4)
- if n <= 500: complexity can be O(n^3)
- if n <= 10^4: complexity can be 0(n^2)
- if n <= 10^7: complexity can be O(n log n) or O(n)

**MATH, BINARY SEARCH**
- if n > 10^8: complexity can be O(1) or O(logn)

### 5. Pattern Recognition
- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAnEeffb5zI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAnEeffb5zI)
- write down all the pattern recognition terms, word usage, etc that signifes it is a type of topic



## TIPS AND THINGS TODO
- scroll through leetcode problems and just read them and try to understand them...
